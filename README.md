# Note Taker App: note-taker

Module 11 - Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

---

## Description

This application was created with the purpose of having an application to take notes as needed. It currently has the ability to write / delete notes that contain a title and some text using a database.

The main goal of this application was to add, delete and update a database with data for each of the notes that a user may have. This specifically challenged recently learned skills to navigate a simple database using express. This is the first application that I have worked on that uses a database to store and access data, instead of using local storage.

### Requirements

A list of requirements derived from acceptance criteria and personal goals:

- Create an application that allows users to create, delete, and edit various notes.
- Functioning save, add, and delete icons.
- Use a database to hold note information.
- Use express to access and navigate the database using different routes.

### Skills Learned/ Improved

Here is a list of some skills I learned and/or improved throughout this project:

- Using express to create routes to navigate the database
- Organizing files into various directories based on file purpose/use
- JavaScript for frontend and backend development
- Using local ports

Tools used to complete this project:

- VS Code
- Terminal
- GitHub
- Heroku
- Node.js
- get-uid
- Express
